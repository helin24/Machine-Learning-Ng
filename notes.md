# Types of supervised learning
Gives correct answer to learning algorithm
Regression
Classification problem - places a line to split different categories
  -Infinite number of attributes eventually

# Types of unsupervised learning
Finding structure in data - do not know in advance what groups are
clustering
market segmentation, space exploration
cocktail party problem - two speakers and two microphones - pass output to an unsupervised learning algorithm and find structure, which distinguishes speakers
octave is a good prototyping, learning tool because people learn it quickly
